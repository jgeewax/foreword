# Decisions and open questions

## 2026-10-16 — Shell: Tauri 2 (WKWebView)

Decided with the user: stay on Tauri. Responsiveness budgets are in SPEC §6 and
must be measured in WebKit. Electron is not the plan.

## 2026-10-17 — Live preview from unsaved buffers (spike: `prototypes/live-preview/`)

**Question:** can the preview follow keystrokes, like Tinymist's preview in VS
Code, with one Tinymist process and nothing saved to disk, at book scale, in WebKit?

**Answer: yes, with partial rendering on.**

How it works (Tinymist 0.15.8, Typst 0.15.1, same commands VS Code's extension uses):

1. `tinymist lsp` over stdio; config `preview.refresh = "onType"`, `compileStatus = "enable"`.
2. `didOpen` the entry and edited files; `workspace/executeCommand tinymist.pinMain [<abs main.typ>]`.
3. `tinymist.doStartPreview [["--task-id", id, "--data-plane-host", "127.0.0.1:0", <abs main.typ>]]`
   returns `{dataPlanePort, staticServerPort}` (same port; binds 127.0.0.1).
4. Embed `http://127.0.0.1:<staticServerPort>/` in an iframe. The page opens its
   WebSocket on its own origin. No `X-Frame-Options`, so framing works.
5. Every Monaco change is sent as an incremental `didChange`. Monaco's per-event
   change list maps 1:1 to LSP `contentChanges` (1-based → 0-based).

Measured on this Mac (Apple Silicon, macOS 26.5). "Preview paint" = key event →
MutationObserver in the preview frame → next frame. Playwright WebKit 26.6
headless; real WKWebView still has to be measured in the Tauri spike.

| | Sample book (5 pp) | Stress book (491 pp, 137k words) |
|---|---|---|
| didChange → compileSuccess (no browser), p50/p95 | 3.6 / 4.9 ms | 87 / 94 ms |
| didChange → preview diff on WebSocket, p50/p95 | 5.2 / 6.1 ms | 95 / 102 ms |
| WebKit, partial on: key → editor paint p50/p95 | 12 / 27 ms | 5 / 17 ms |
| WebKit, partial on: key → preview paint p50/p95 | 38 / 44 ms | 132 / 140 ms |
| WebKit, partial **off**: key → editor paint p50/p95 | — | **1327 / 6624 ms** |
| Chromium, partial on: key → preview paint p50/p95 | — | 118 / 130 ms |
| Typing at 60 ms/key: last key → preview shows it | 34 ms | ~150 ms (both engines) |
| Syntax error → diagnostic; preview keeps last good render | 1 ms; yes | 64 ms; yes |

All within the SPEC §6 targets (key → preview p50 ≤ 150 ms, p95 ≤ 400 ms), with
partial rendering on.

### Findings that affect the design

1. **Partial rendering is mandatory in WebKit.** With it off, the stress book
   puts ~1M nodes in the preview DOM and **freezes the editor** (key → editor paint
   p50 1.3 s). The preview iframe runs on the same main thread as Monaco.
2. **Isolate the preview from the editor's main thread.** Even with partial
   rendering, any slow preview render competes with typing. Done in the app: the
   preview is a separate Tauri child webview (see 2026-10-17).
3. ~~WebKit bug: partial rendering + `tinymist.scrollPreview`.~~ Misdiagnosed;
   see "WebKit page-order bug" below (2026-10-17). The real cause is width- and
   engine-dependent, not the scroll command.
4. ~~`tinymist.scrollPreview` never sends a `jump`.~~ Wrong: it only jumps for
   positions that map to rendered content, and my test positions didn't. See
   "Source ↔ preview sync" (2026-10-17).
5. Tinymist logs that WebSocket clients without an `Origin` header "will be a hard
   error in the future". The app's preview connection must send one.
6. Tinymist sends `compileSuccess` twice per edit (word count is updated in the
   second). Don't treat the first one as final document stats.
7. WebKit does one extra preview repaint ~1.1 s after typing stops, after the
   content is already correct (Chromium doesn't). Harmless so far; watch for flicker.
8. Typst 0.15 renamed `angle.l/r` to `chevron.l/r` (fixed in the sample book).

## 2026-10-17 — Tauri app (Phase 0)

### Measured in the real app (WKWebView, dev build, Apple Silicon)

In-app self-test (`src/selftest.ts`): Monaco's typing pipeline (`editor.trigger('type')`,
not OS key events), nothing saved, everything undone afterwards. Preview not
scrolled to the edited page, so "edit → preview" is compile + transfer + update
of the visible pages.

| | Sample book (5 pp) | Stress book (491 pp) | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edit → editor paint, isolated p50/p95 | 9 / 19 ms | 8 / 12 ms | p95 ≤ 16 ms |
| Edit → editor paint, typing at 60 ms/key | 5 / 18 ms | 6 / 18 ms | p95 ≤ 16 ms |
| Edit → preview paint, isolated p50/p95 | 25 / 30 ms | 140 / 185 ms | ≤ 150 / 400 ms |
| Preview ready after page load | 0.6 s | 1.0 s | — |
| Unsaved text reaches the compiled book | 238 → 245 words | 137534 → 137541 | — |

Editor p95 is at or slightly over 16 ms in a dev build (unminified React with
StrictMode, full Monaco bundle); re-measure in a release build before tuning.

Agent turn (same self-test): `litellm/gemini-3.8-flash` picked automatically, two
selected lines attached as `chapters/ch2-eigenvalues.typ:3–4`, the agent ran
`read` on the chapter and streamed a correct answer (first text 5.2 s, turn 5.4 s).

### Architecture decisions

- **Preview in a separate child webview** (`Window::add_child`, Tauri `unstable`
  feature), positioned over the preview pane by the frontend. Confirmed: the
  491-page book no longer affects editor latency. Cost: HTML overlays from the
  main webview can't draw over the preview, and keyboard shortcuts don't reach
  the app while the preview has focus (fix later with native menu accelerators).
- **Capabilities:** the main webview gets all app commands; the preview webview
  (remote `http://127.0.0.1:*`) may only call `perf_report`. Each command has its
  own permission (`tauri_build::AppManifest::commands`).
- **`typst_send` is a sync command.** Async commands run concurrently and could
  reorder `didChange` notifications; sync commands run in arrival order. File
  and workspace commands are async so disk I/O stays off the main thread.
- **OpenCode is reached only through Rust** (`agent.rs`): per-launch random
  password via `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` (verified honoured), no CORS exposure,
  the password never reaches the webview.
- **Helper processes:** tinymist exits when its stdin closes; `opencode serve`
  doesn't. SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP now go through the normal exit path, and spawned
  OpenCode PIDs are recorded (`children.rs`) so leftovers from a crash or force
  quit are terminated on the next launch (matched by command line, never by PID
  alone). Verified: SIGTERM stops app, tinymist and opencode together.
- **Rust from Homebrew** (`brew install rust`, 1.99), not rustup: no shell
  changes needed. Universal (Intel) builds in Phase 5 will need rustup.

### OpenCode 2.x (installed: 2.0.20)

- 2.x serves a new API (`/api/...`, 116 routes, `/openapi.json` behind auth);
  the npm `@opencode-ai/sdk` (1.19.3) targets the old one. The adapter calls the
  HTTP API directly, with shapes checked against the server's own OpenAPI file
  and recorded traffic (`src/services/agent/__fixtures__/opencode-events.jsonl`).
- Event stream: `GET /api/event` (SSE, untyped `data`). Turn end is
  `session.execution.succeeded`; a **rejected permission ends the turn with no
  execution event**, so the UI also checks `GET /api/session/active`
  (`{data: {"<sessionID>": {type: "running"}}}` while running, `{}` when idle).
- `permission.asked` carries the proposed diff (`metadata.files[].patch`), which
  the permission card shows before approval.
- **Built-in agents allow everything** (`* → allow`). Sessions are created with
  our own rules: ask by default; allow read/glob/grep/list; ask for `.env` reads
  and external directories; deny `task` (subagents run with allow-all rules).
  Last match wins (verified for read vs edit). The `task` action name is
  unverified.
- **The model list fills in lazily.** The first `/api/model` call after startup
  listed only `openai`; a few seconds later it listed all providers. The server
  default (`opencode/exo-free`) isn't in the list at all.

### Bugs found by testing the app

- **Wrong default model** (reported by the user): with the default missing, the
  picker fell back to the alphabetically first model, an LM Studio model without
  tool support, which failed with "OpenAI Chat stream ended without
  finish_reason". Fix: `chooseModel` never auto-picks a model without tools;
  order is saved choice → server default → LiteLLM → any tool-capable model;
  tool-less models are disabled in the picker. Errors show once, prefixed with
  the model.
- **WebKit page-order bug** (reported by the user: "title page missing, starts
  with References"). Tinymist's preview draws off-screen pages as canvas
  previews inside `<foreignObject>`, shrunk with `transform: scale()`. WebKit
  paints transformed HTML in a foreignObject without the parent group's
  `translate`, so all off-screen pages land on page 1. Reproduced in Playwright
  WebKit at preview-pane widths (~420 px), with or without partial rendering;
  Chromium is fine. The DOM is correct; only painting is wrong. Fix (injected
  CSS in the preview webview): size the canvas with `width/height: 100%` instead
  of the transform. Same appearance, correct positions, sharp previews while
  scrolling. A first attempt (hiding the previews) made pages go blank after
  scrolling until the 500 ms debounced redraw, or until a click (also
  user-reported), so it was replaced. Worth reporting upstream (typst.ts).
- **Self-test never started:** `LaunchOptions` serialized as snake_case, the
  frontend read camelCase. Tauri converts command *arguments* to camelCase, not
  return values; structs with multi-word fields need `rename_all = "camelCase"`.

### Preview rendering in the real WKWebView (second round, user-reported)

Reported: pages blank after scrolling until a click; References drawn above the
title page. My first fixes passed in Playwright WebKit but not in the app,
because Playwright's WebKit differs in exactly the two ways that matter:

1. **No `requestIdleCallback`** in Playwright WebKit (so typst.ts falls back to
   `setTimeout`); the real WKWebView has it. typst.ts paints canvas previews in
   an idle callback and every later update awaits that pass. In the preview
   webview idle callbacks stalled until user input, which blocked rendering
   until a click. Fix: shim `requestIdleCallback` with `setTimeout` in the
   preview's init script.
2. **GPU-accelerated canvases** in the real WKWebView are composited layers,
   which WebKit mispositions inside `<foreignObject>` (same bug as the CSS
   transform). Fix: request software canvases (`willReadFrequently: true`) in
   addition to the transform-free CSS sizing.
3. The renderer waits 500 ms after the last scroll event before drawing newly
   visible pages; after a long jump they were blank that long. Fix: dispatch a
   window `resize` 120 ms after scrolling stops (its resize handler redraws
   immediately).

**Verification now uses the real app.** The self-test takes PNG snapshots of
the preview WKWebView (`takeSnapshotWithConfiguration`, includes composited
layers) and records which pages are SVG vs canvas. Sample and 491-page books:
pages in order and painted 150 ms after scrolling to the end and back
(491-page book: pages 490–491 fully rendered 150 ms after a 315,000 px jump).
`screencapture` isn't usable from the agent's environment.

### Source ↔ preview sync

- **Preview → source:** Tinymist sends the standard LSP request
  `window/showDocument` (`{uri, selection, takeFocus}`), not the
  `tinymist/preview/scrollSource` notification VS Code's extension handles
  (that path needs a client flag). Both are handled: open the file, select,
  center, and give keyboard focus back to the editor (`focus_main`).
- **Source → preview:** `tinymist.scrollPreview` + `panelScrollTo` does jump
  (finding 4 above was wrong), but only for positions that map to rendered
  content: never column 0; inside words of running text almost always; code
  (`#figure(...)`), labels and some math not. Failures are silent. A heading
  renders twice (TOC and body) and the preview picks the copy nearest the
  current page.
- Implementation: on cursor settle (150 ms), try candidates best-first
  (`src/editor/preview-sync.ts`: cursor, other words on the line, nearest text
  lines above; on a heading, the first content line below), and stop at the
  first one the preview actually jumps to. The preview webview reports jumps by
  wrapping its WebSocket in an init script. Result: one smooth scroll and one
  ripple per cursor move. Measured in-app: 1 jump per move on both books; a
  heading lands in the body, not the TOC.

### UI zoom (⌘= / ⌘− / ⌘0)

- Native page zoom of the main webview (`Webview::set_zoom`, WKWebView
  `pageZoom`), like VS Code's Electron window zoom; CSS `zoom` would break
  Monaco's hit-testing. Steps 50–250 % (browser steps); persisted; status-bar
  indicator resets on click. The preview webview isn't zoomed: its pages fit
  the pane width either way.
- Shortcuts: a capture-phase key handler in the main webview (⌘=, ⇧⌘= i.e. ⌘+,
  ⌘−, ⌘0), plus View-menu items with the same accelerators so zoom works while
  the preview has focus. A press seen by both is applied once.
- The preview webview is placed in window points, so its pane rect is scaled by
  the zoom. Verified in-app at 125 % and 80 %: within 0.5 pt of the pane.

### Title-bar inset (macOS 26)

Windows get a full-size content view: the main webview spans the 32 pt title
bar and WebKit insets the page (`safeAreaInsets.top = 32`; page viewport 968 pt
in a 1000 pt webview). The preview webview, positioned in window coordinates,
was therefore 32 pt too high (covering the preview header, leaving a gap at the
bottom). It now adds the main webview's native safe-area inset, re-read on
resize (full screen removes the title bar). Verified natively: preview top =
pane top (off by 0 pt).

### Helper processes, revised

The child-process registry is now per app instance (`children-<pid>.json`).
The first version used one file, so a second instance (e.g. a self-test next
to the user's window) would have terminated the first instance's OpenCode.
Files of instances that are still running are left alone. `tauri dev` restarts
the app with SIGKILL on Rust changes, so the next start reaps the old helpers.

### Open questions

- Release-build numbers, and real keyboard input (the self-test types through
  Monaco, not OS key events; the status bar HUD measures real keys).
- Cold start to editable workspace (§6 budget 1.5 s): boot reaches an open
  workspace at ~0.4–0.7 s after navigation in dev; app launch → navigation not yet measured.
- Monaco bundle is 4.8 MB (all languages). Trim to the editor core + JSON if
  cold start needs it.
- Upstream reports for typst.ts: foreignObject canvas previews in WebKit, and
  idle-callback dependency of the update loop.
- Whether the cursor indicator (`changeCursorPosition`) comes back. Tinymist
  currently says it's "temporarily disabled".

## Tooling on this machine (2026-10-16)
